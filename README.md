Victor Tran's GitHub setup for GA DTLA

Hi GADTLA! I'm an avid traveler and I'm mostly looking forward to this program to make money and volunteering apps that'll allow me to travel more and continue this cycle!
Also, please let me know if any opportunities come up in the near future after the program. THANKS!
